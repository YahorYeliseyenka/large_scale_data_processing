They also state that you can be **below** this age, but only if they \"know you\"). \\n\\nCrew Hazbin is a Discord server based on Hazbin Hotel roleplays and other things related to that fandom. \\n\\nMimi2001 is 19, and lives in Germany. Her boyfriend zATOMICxMASTERz is ~21-22. He is supposedly in the UK. \\n\\nAll of the users involved own a VRchat account, and a Discord account. Multiple own Twitter accounts. \\n\\nCrew Hazbin has a Twitter account (referenced in the Twitter thread)\\n\\nJayskillet, a person who I have spoken to personally about this issue was 13 when this all happened in June. Mimi2001 has said that he too is also in Germany, but I haven\\'t asked him myself. \\n\\nAs far as some of the hot takes I made in this-- I was a bit scared and didn\\'t really know what I was doing. Eventually through trial and error I was able to correctly form a story based on the images and screenshots or video that I have. Early on you can likely see me say things that are pretty much just speculation or irrelevant details such as me claiming Hellspawn was a pedophile, while not realizing in most states you need to be at 5 years older than the minor for this to even matter. Being completely honest I legitimately believed that anyone who engaged in sexual activity with a even if they\\'re a minor themselves would be considered a pedophile. I already know this isn\\'t the case so please just ignore those claims as they were made back in July when this was being documented originally. I also made the claim that the Federal Data Protection Act forbids anyone to be on social media platforms hosted or made in Germany while under the age of 16-- When it actually forbids anyone under the age of 16 *within Germany* to be on social media platforms. Just an error that I made when skimming through the surface level information I had at the time.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow onto the actual meat and potatoes of this debacle. \\n\\nBelow is a Twitter thread leading to multiple instances of her actions with minors along with short references on Hellspawn, Blue, and Sans. \\n\\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/OccidoP/status/1325955760115900418 \\n\\nIt\\'s currently unfinished, and likely won\\'t be finished until I add a few more screenshots of her activity within the server. I have to balance school ontop of this, and It\\'s been alot. Having no experience in something like this while trying to make a compelling case against them online is difficult. \\n\\nNow-- They have constantly claimed that what I have presented on Twitter and to many of their members in an attempted to recruit spies on their server to monitor their activity, grab message links for Discord staff, and also possibly get reactions when given hypothetical questions that relate to certain situations they have already been in. \\n\\nOne of such hypothetical situations I presented to her myself on one of the videos in the thread was if Blue, someone Hellspawn groomed and used for sexts-- Hurt herself as a result of what he did. Mimi insisted twice on video that she thought those who hurt themselves because of nudes are \"dumb\" and those who commit suicide \"just a weak fuck\". \\n\\nNevermind that Blue is a fucking 14 year old. \\n\\nShe literally allows Hellspawn to continue to manipulate her. To hurt her. To \"get back\" at her. \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNow-- This might be scraping the rules. I don\\'t know where this falls between any of it, but I tried my best to exclude any form of call to action here. I just need advice in creating a compelling argument so hopefully with the revised argument-- I can bring this to some commentary channel on youtube or have someone cover this. \\n\\nI\\'ve spent 4 months in this hell, all I ask is for help and advice',\n",

       "  'This year i’ve had diamond jerry west, diamond jason kidd, pink diamond bob cousy, and diamond isiah thomas. Out of all those guys no one has a more wet green light than ja. his shot release is really easy, his dunks are some of the best in the game right now, and i’m constantly getting green light contested layups. Out of those i mentioned only kidd has comparable defense. His off the dribble 3 is always wet when you find space. I just played against PD curry and babied him. Curry would be the only card close imo but his defense ruins the matchup and makes ja better in myteam right now. Any other point guards you guys can vouch for that i haven’t mentioned? Also i just put a diamond shoe on ja that makes his driving dunk a 98, speed with ball a 95, and vertical 97. \\n\\nThis post comes off the heels of me beating a pd curry team with jaylen brown, kd, amare, and sabonis ja is amazing',\n",
